# Sea War

## Description

Sea War is a simple console-based game implemented in C++. Players take turns to place ships on a grid and then attempt to sink each other's ships by guessing their locations. The game incorporates basic logic and strategic gameplay.

## Features

- **Grid-based gameplay**: Players set up their ships on a 10x10 grid.
- **Ship types**: Different types of ships with varying lengths.
- **Turn-based play**: Players take turns guessing the locations of their opponent's ships.
- **Game status updates**: Players receive feedback on their guesses (hit, miss, or sunk).

## How to Play

1. **Setup**:
   - Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio).
   - Run the executable to start the game.

2. **Place Ships**:
   - Each player will place their ships on the grid. The default ship types and sizes are defined in the game.

3. **Taking Turns**:
   - Players take turns guessing the coordinates of their opponent's ships. Input coordinates in the format (row, column).

4. **Guessing**:
   - After each guess, the game will indicate whether the shot was a hit, miss, or if a ship was sunk.

5. **Winning**:
   - The game continues until one player has sunk all of the opponent's ships.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio).
- Basic understanding of C++ to compile and run the game.
